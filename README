# Alpha: a movie database

At its most basic, this is an learning development

I will be developing a movie database application of sorts to get aquainted with Ruby on Rails (and app development in general)

Developed on Ubuntu 10.10, using the Vim editor.

Environment:
* Ruby 1.8.7
* Rails 3.0.5
* RSpec
